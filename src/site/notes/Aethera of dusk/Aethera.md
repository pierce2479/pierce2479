The world of Aethera is shaped by the complex and often volatile relationship between the [[Aethera of dusk/The Seven\|The Seven]], each a powerful force with distinct domains. They once coexisted in an uneasy harmony, maintaining balance in the world and guiding humanity in different ways. But the **End**, the most enigmatic and destructive of them all, began to crave dominion over everything, threatening to tear the fabric of reality itself. When **The End** attempted to seize control, it led to a cataclysmic battle with the other six Deities. The ensuing conflict was so fierce that it nearly shattered the world, but the remaining gods were able to combine their strength to form the The shattered veil, a mystical barrier that would seal away **The End** and protect the world from his wrath. However, this victory came at a high price. The Veil fractured reality itself, causing the world to split between the light and the **[[Aethera of dusk/Eternal Dusk\|Eternal Dusk]]**, a realm of perpetual twilight that consumed the land and twisted the creatures that inhabited it.

**[[Aethera of dusk/The kingdoms\|The kingdoms]]** that survived the **Shattered Veil** now stand as bastions of civilization, each one founded by a different Deity and shaped by their teachings and powers. The kingdom of **Mirael**, bathed in the radiant light of the **Wisened**, became a place of knowledge and enlightenment. **Zahrah**, with its deep connection to **The Wanderer**, developed as a refuge for those seeking adventure and self-discovery. But not all survived unscathed. **Korath**, the kingdom that once thrived under **Exiled**, fell into ruin, abandoned by its people after the calamity caused the **Exiled** to disappear. Though the kingdoms are united in their shared struggle for survival, their existence is fragile. Humanity now faces a constant threat from the encroaching **Eternal Dusk** and the creatures that roam its realms, twisted by the broken magic of the Veil. The arrival of **Dungeons**, mysterious areas that spawn randomly throughout the land, has further disrupted the fragile peace. These Dungeons are not portals but manifestations of the world’s fractured reality, where the laws of nature no longer apply. In the Dusk, these Dungeons are abundant, filled with powerful monsters and ancient treasures, but even in the light, they occasionally appear, presenting new challenges and dangers for those brave enough to enter.

The world has irrevocably changed. The once stable and predictable lands are now riddled with **Dungeons**, where the fabric of reality bends, monsters lurk, and treasures await those daring enough to seek them. The **Eternal Dusk** continues to creep into the safer territories, corrupting everything in its path, while the kingdoms of the living must constantly adapt to protect themselves. As the **Essence Spark**—the light of life—within every living being acts as a beacon, it becomes increasingly vital for the people to navigate this new world of survival. However, it is still unclear what fate awaits humanity in this fractured world, as the **End** lies dormant, waiting for the opportunity to rise again. Even now, the Deities watch over their realms with bated breath, knowing that the Veil is not permanent, and that the struggle for dominance may one day begin anew.
